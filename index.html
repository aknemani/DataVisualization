      <p><font size = "5px"><b>Study of Student's Scores Using Data Visualization</b></font></p>
      <p>In this project, I have done analysis on a dataset of exam scores. The dataset includes scores from three exams: Maths, Reading and Writing. 
	  In our analysis, I have clubbed Reading and Writing into a joint category called ‘English’. However, if there is any interest in seeing the breakup, I provide that info in the tool tip. 
	  I have developed six different scenes: I want to first analyse if students good in maths would be good in English also. This will help into analysing if we need to focus on Maths or English, to 
	  improve the overall score of students. I also see if this relationship varies depending on different personal, social and economic factors. In next three scenes, 
	  I analyse the impact of the impact of these factors on total scores. In the next few pages, you can see the overall trends and 
	  then play with different selection methods to see if any specific case had any influence. A detailed 
	report of the graph has been posted <a href='DataVisualizationReportAshishNemani.pdf'>here</a>.</p>
