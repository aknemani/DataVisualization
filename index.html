      <p><font size = "5px"><b>Study of Student's Scores Using Data Visualization</b></font></p>
      <p>In this project, I have done analysis on a dataset of exam scores. The dataset includes scores from three exams: Maths, Reading and Writing and the personal, social, and economic background. 
	  In this analysis, I have clubbed Reading and Writing into a joint category called ‘English’. However, if there is any interest in seeing the breakup, I provide that info in the tool tip. 
	  I have developed six different scenes besides this introductory scene: In first three slides, we analyse if Maths and English scores have any positive correlation and also if this relationship holds for different
	socio-economic and gender background by filtering on it through a dropdown selection. This will help into analysing if we need to focus on Maths or English, to 
	  improve the overall score of students. In next three scenes (4-6), we analyse the impact of Training, Parent's education, and Ethnic background on total scores. We also see if the pattern found is followed
	  by both male and female for each of these scenes. A detailed report of the graph has been posted <b><a href='DataVisualizationReportAshishNemani.pdf'>here</a></b>.</p>
